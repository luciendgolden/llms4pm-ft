        "This notebook replicates and extends the experiments from **“Evaluating the Ability of LLMs to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks”** on three semantics-aware tasks: **T‑SAD** (trace anomaly detection), **A‑SAD** (eventually-follows order validation), and **S‑NAP** (next-activity prediction). It reports both **in‑context learning (ICL)** and **fine‑tuning (FT)** settings, with comparisons to reference scores from the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Evaluating the Ability of LLMs to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02310)\n",
        "\n",
        "**ICL results** show performance close to random baselines on classification tasks (T‑SAD/A‑SAD), while S‑NAP benefits more noticeably from ICL. Among ICL models, **Llama** tends to outperform **Mistral**, especially on **S‑NAP**, indicating that next-activity prediction is more responsive to prompt-based reasoning than anomaly/order classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fine‑tuning results** substantially improve performance across all tasks. FT Llama and FT Mistral achieve **high F1 scores** on T‑SAD and A‑SAD, and **marked gains on S‑NAP** compared to ICL. These results align with the paper’s conclusion that semantics-aware process mining tasks benefit strongly from supervised fine‑tuning rather than purely prompt-based inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the replication confirms that **ICL offers limited gains for semantic validation tasks**, while **fine‑tuning is consistently effective**, especially for tasks requiring structured understanding of process behavior."
